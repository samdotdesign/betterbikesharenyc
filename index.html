                <h1>Citi Bike must prioritize service in underprivileged neighborhoods. </h3> 
            
                <p>Neighborhoods on the outskirts of Citi Bike’s service area experience lower reliability compared to those closer to the center. These areas are often home 
                    to Black, Latinx, and low-income residents. The result is an inequitable public service.</p>
                <p>Together, we can push for change to ensure every resident has a reliable and affordable biking option.</p>

                <h2>The problems</h2>

                <p><h3>Unreliable service on the edges of the network</h3></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Neighborhoods on the edge of the network suffer more from unusable stations. This disproportionately affects Black, Latinx, and low-income residents.</li>
                    <li>Rebalancing bikes dropped 80% from 2014-2019 to 2022.</li>
                    <li>Riders in the Bronx are 89% more likely to encounter unusable stations compared to other boroughs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><h3>Lack of contract enforcement</h3></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Despite numerous service failures, the city hasn’t enforced the performance standards agreed by Lyft.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><h3>High cost</h3></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Current discounts for NYCHA and SNAP recipients are great, but they are inadequate and convoluted for many low-income New Yorkers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The solutions</h2>

                <ul>
                    
                    <li>Lyft, who operates Citi Bike, must prioritize maintenance in underserved areas to ensure equitable service.</li>
                    <li>The city needs neighborhood-level performance standards for Lyft to follow. The results should be shared publicly.</li>
                    <li>The city must respond to Lyft’s performance with fines when compliance isn’t met, and rewards when performance is good.</li>
                    <li>Expand and simplify eligibility for discounted memberships to reach more low-income residents.</li>
                </ul>
